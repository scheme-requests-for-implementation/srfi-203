<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>This SRFI proposes a simple library for programmatic drawing of
pictures compatible with Section 2.2.4 of <cite>Structure and
Interpretation of Computer Programs</cite>.</p>

<p>It aims to close the gap between the Scheme suggested for study in
the book and portable Scheme.</p>

<h2>Issues</h2>

<ol>
<li> <code>canvas-reset</code> and <code>canvas-cleanup</code> are not
called <code>canvas-reset!</code> and <code>canvas-cleanup!</code>,
although they are definitely called for side effects. However, in SICP
the procedures <code>draw-line</code> and <code>rogers</code> do not
bear an exclamation mark, either.</li>

</ol>

<h2>Rationale</h2>

<p><cite>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</cite> (SICP),
by Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman with Julie Sussman, is one of the
world's most famous programming textbooks. The code examples in the book are
given in Scheme, and the exercises are mostly expected to be done in Scheme.
The examples and exercises are best executed with a Scheme system
that implements a reasonable subset of the Scheme language.
Furthermore, the textbook assumes the existence of several primitives not
included in any of the Scheme reports.
Most of these primitives are already either covered by other relevant SRFIs,
or can be implemented on top of those.
The picture language of Section 2.2.4 cannot, however, be portably
implemented using any of the portable Scheme libraries.
This SRFI aims to fill this gap.</p>

<p>
Potentially, this SRFI may serve as one of the building blocks on
which another SRFI, dedicated to
providing in full all the
language facilities assumed by SICP, may be implemented.
</p>

<p>This SRFI is not a complete implementation of the picture language as it is
presented in Section 2.2.4.
This is intentional. The scope of this SRFI is not to implement the whole
drawing library presented, but only to implement a minimal subset on top of
which the code from the book can be run.
This leads to procedures accepting as arguments certain data structures
for which constructors are not provided within this SRFI.
Those should be sufficiently easy to implement using the code from the book.
Nevertheless, the code from the sample implementation test file can be
reused.</p>

<!-- added after an email by John Cowan -->
<p>
This SRFI can be compared to
<a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-96/srfi-96.html">SRFI 96</a>,
which is to SLIB as this SRFI
is to the SICP drawing language. SRFI 96 makes no attempt to document
SLIB (which has over 200 modules), much less to extend it.
Instead, it documents the constants, variables, procedures, and
syntax forms that a Scheme must provide in order to fully host SLIB,
which amount to less than forty.
</p>

<h2>Specification</h2>


<!-- <P> -->
<!-- <DL> -->
<!-- <DT><U>Parameter:</U> <code>canvas-size</code> -->
<!-- <DD> -->
<!-- For pixel-based displays, defines the size of the canvas in pixels. -->
<!-- For all other types of displays, defines the size of the canvas in the units -->
<!-- most natural for that type of display. -->
<!-- The default value is 200. -->
<!-- </DL> -->


<!-- <P> -->
<!-- <DL> -->
<!-- <DT><U>Parameter:</U> <code>canvas-name</code> -->
<!-- <DD> -->
<!-- Defines a system-dependent name for a file. -->
<!-- </DL> -->

<p>
A "canvas" is anything that the drawing procedures draw on. It may be
a window, or a file, or some other drawing device. Due to the great
variety of available Scheme implementations and hardware on which they
run, it is hard to specify what is a canvas precisely, but it should
be a certain location where the result of the drawing procedures is
stored. It may be a file, a buffer, a window, or a certain Scheme
object dedicated to keep a list of instructions to be flushed to a
real graphics system later.
</p>

<p>
As far as the code of SICP is concerned, it is legitimate to call
any drawing routine at any time, without prior initialization of a canvas.
So, each of the drawing routines has to create a canvas if it
does not exist.
They should, however, draw on an existing one if it does exist.
</p>

<p>
Many systems are likely to use a so-called "double-buffering"
or "delayed drawing" technique, in which drawing and displaying what has been
drawn are two different operations.
On the other hand, some systems are expected to try and implement this SRFI
in a "value-based" way, that is to change the state of the display by
using some display operation on a Scheme
value. (This is the approach
used by the Kawa sample implementation, which displays the "picture
value" returned by <code>canvas-refresh</code> in a graphical REPL.)
Other systems may use other routines not specified by this SRFI to
display the "picture value", if pictures are represented as values.
</p>

<DL>
<DT><U>Procedure:</U> <code>(canvas-reset)</code>
<DD>
Ensures that the canvas on which subsequent calls to drawing procedures will
draw is blank. The return value is unspecified.

<p>
<i>Explanation:</i> Graphics systems differ, and giving a precise definition
to <code>(canvas-reset)</code> is hard. If the graphics system only supports
a single graphical display (as the DOS systems used to), this procedure
is expected to make this display empty.
If the system is window-based, it will probably create a
new window.
If the only drawing is done at the moment that the "picture value" is
output into the REPL, this procedure is expected to do some off-screen
operations that will ensure that subsequent calls to the drawing
procedures will be drawing on an empty canvas.
</p>


<DT><U>Procedure:</U> <code>(canvas-refresh)</code>
<DD>
Updates the display in an implementation-defined manner to reflect the
state of the canvas. Returns a system-dependent identifier (not to be
confused with a Scheme identifier) of the canvas.

The canvas may not exist unless it has been drawn on.

<p>
<i>Explanation:</i>

<code>(canvas-refresh)</code> is an attempt to reconcile as many drawing
approaches as possible.
</p>

<p>
After a call to <code>(canvas-refresh)</code> the state of the display
(whatever it may be) is expected to be a faithful representation of the
image drawn by a sequence of calls to the drawing routines, regardless of
the underlying approach that a system is using.
</p>

<p>
If the system "displays" the return value in some sort of a
graphical REPL (like the Kawa sample implementation does), <code>(canvas-refresh)</code> returns a
"picture value", that is expected to be displayed by the REPL.
If the system has a separate windowing subsystem, not connected to the
REPL in any meaningful way, the call to <code>(canvas-refresh)</code>
should guarantee that the window, on which the canvas is displayed,
is presenting the final result of the drawing and displaying to the user.
</p>

<p>
If <code>(canvas-refresh)</code> is called and no canvas exists, the implementations are expected to
do something reasonable. In the case of the sample file-based implementation,
<code>(canvas-refresh)</code> returns a file name that could have been
used for drawing, which may or may not exist.
In case of a window-based implementation, it is reasonable to return
a value that could serve as a valid window identifier.
If an implementation displays images in the REPL,
<code>(canvas-refresh)</code> might return an empty picture value.
</p>

<p>
<code>(canvas-refresh)</code> thus has both "pure" and side-effecting
semantics: it may change the display, or it may simply return a value
which can be displayed, or it may do nothing.
</p>

<DT><U>Procedure:</U> <code>(canvas-cleanup)</code>
<DD>
Deletes the current canvas and cleans the space it occupies.
The return value is unspecified.

<DT><U>Procedure:</U> <code>(draw-line start end)</code>
<DD>
Draws a line on the canvas starting at <code>(car start)</code> , <code> (car
(cdr start))</code> and ending at <code>(car end)</code> , <code> (car
(cdr end))</code>.

It is an error if <code>start</code> is not a list of at least two numbers.
It is an error if <code>end</code> is not a list of at least two numbers.

If the canvas does not exist, it is created.

<DT><U>Procedure:</U> <code>(rogers v-list)</code>
<DD>
<p>Draws an image of MIT's founder, William Barton Rogers, as shown in
Figure 2.11 of SICP, on the canvas so that it fits the frame defined
by the vectors <code>(car v-list)</code>, <code>(car (cdr v-list))</code> and
<code>(car (cdr (cdr v-list)))</code> in a natural linear algebraic way.</p>

<p>
It is an error if <code>v-list</code> is not a list of at least three elements,
each of which is a list of at least two numbers.</p>

<p>If the canvas does not exist, it is created. </p>

<p>
<code>v-list</code> may be one of the possible implementations of a frame,
in the SICP terminology. However, in order to avoid nudging the potential
users of the library into a particular implementation of frames, we
opted to specify one of the possible underlying data structures directly.
Converting between this representation, as well as any other representation,
should be a relatively simple exercise.</p>

</DL>

<h3>Additional procedures</h3>

<p>These procedures, although they are not strictly needed for SICP, may make
programming with the picture language less mundane.</p>

<DT><U>Procedure:</U> <code>(jpeg-file->painter file-name)</code>
<DD>

<p>If <code>file-name</code> exists and is a JPEG file,
<code>jpeg-file->painter</code> returns
a painter similar to <code>rogers</code>, that is a procedure that
accepts a frame and draws the image located at <code>file-name</code>
shifted, rotated, and skewed to fit into the frame.
Otherwise, the result is unspecified. </p>

<DT><U>Procedure:</U> <code>(image-file->painter file-name)</code>
<DD>

<p>If <code>image-name</code> exists, and is a file that can be
interpreted as containing a representation of an image, and
the implementation supports loading such a kind of files,
<code>image-file->painter</code> returns
a painter similar to <code>rogers</code>, that is a procedure that
accepts a frame and draws the image located at <code>file-name</code>
shifted, rotated, and skewed to fit into the frame.
Otherwise, the result is unspecified.
</p>
<p>
In the simplest case this procedure
can be a synonym to <code>jpeg-file->painter</code>.</p>

</DL>



<h2> Examples </h2>

<p>
The exemplar use of this SRFI can be found in the
attached <code>srfi-sicp-pictures.org</code> file, which exploits
the <code>org-display-inline-images</code> feature of Emacs&#39; <code>org-mode</code>.
</p>

The code below is more or less a copy of the code from the test. When
in doubt, consider referring to the org file.

<pre>
(import (scheme red))
(import (srfi 203))

(define (make-vect xcor ycor . o)
  (append (list xcor) (list ycor) o))

(define (make-frame origin edge1 edge2)
  (list origin edge1 edge2))

(canvas-reset)
(landau (make-frame (make-vect 0 0) (make-vect 0.5 0.0) (make-vect 0.0 0.5)))
(rogers (make-frame (make-vect 0.5 0.5) (make-vect 0.5 0.0) (make-vect 0.0 0.5)))
(draw-line (make-vect 0.5 0.5) (make-vect 0 1.0))
(draw-bezier (make-vect 0.0 0.5)
             (make-vect 0.0 1)
             (make-vect 0.5 0.5)
             (make-vect 0.5 1)
)
(define testpainter (jpeg-file->painter "lambda.jpg"))
(testpainter (make-frame (make-vect 0.5 0.0) (make-vect 0.5 0.1) (make-vect 0.1 0.5)))
(display (canvas-refresh))

</pre>

<h2>Implementation</h2>

<p>The <code>203.sld</code> and <code>203.scm</code> files constitute
a simple file-based implementation, in which the "system-dependent
identifier" corresponds to a file name.</p>

<p> <code>canvas-name</code> and <code>canvas-size</code> should be
parameterised by the same <code>parameterize</code> form.</p>

<p>The sample implementation litters the file system with bogus files.
This is a consequence of the generality. Scheme system specific
implementations are encouraged to provide a method of garbage collection.</p>

<p>The <code>extra</code> directory provides an additional implementation
for Kawa scheme, as well as a test file <code>kawatest.scm</code> and
additional resources that may be found helpful when implementing this
SRFI.</p>
