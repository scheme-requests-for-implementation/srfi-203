<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>This SRFI proposes a simple library for programmatic drawing of
pictures compatible with the Section 2.2.4 of the Structure and
Interpretation of Computer Programs.</p>

<p>It aims to close the gap between the Scheme suggested for study in
the book and portable Scheme.</p>

<h2>Issues</h2>

<ol>
<li>Parameterizing the canvas name or the canvas size may lead to unexpected
results.</li>
<li> <code>canvas-reset</code> and <code>canvas-cleanup</code> are not
called <code>canvas-reset!</code> and <code>canvas-cleanup!</code>,
although they are definitely called for side effects. However, in SICP
the procedures <code>draw-line</code> and <code>rogers</code> do not
bear an exclamation mark, either.</li>
<li><code>canvas-name</code> and <code>canvas-size</code> do not behave very
well.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Rationale</h2>

<p>The <cite>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</cite> is one of the
world's most famous programming textbooks. The code examples in the book are
given in Scheme, and the exercises are mostly expected to be done in Scheme.
The examples and exercises are best executed with a Scheme system
that implements a reasonable subset of the Scheme language.
Furthermore, the textbook assumes the existence of several primitives not
included in any of the Scheme reports.
Most of these primitives are already either covered by other relevant SRFIs,
or can be implemented on top of those.
The picture language of the Section 2.2.4 cannot, however, be portably
implemented using any of the portable Scheme libraries.
This SRFI aims to fill this gap.</p>

<p>This SRFI is not a complete implementation of the picture language as it is
presented in the Section 2.2.4.
This is intentional. The scope of this SRFI is not to implement the whole
drawing library presented, but only to implement the minimal subset on top of
which the code from the book can be run.
This leads to procedures accepting as arguments certain data structures
for which constructors are not provided within this SRFI.
Those should be sufficiently easy to implement using the code from the book.
Nevertheless, the code from the sample implementation test file can be
reused.</p>

<h2>Specification</h2>


<!-- <P> -->
<!-- <DL> -->
<!-- <DT><U>Parameter:</U> <code>canvas-size</code> -->
<!-- <DD> -->
<!-- For pixel-based displays, defines the size of the canvas in pixels. -->
<!-- For all other types of displays, defines the size of the canvas in the units -->
<!-- most natural for that type of display. -->
<!-- The default value is 200. -->
<!-- </DL> -->


<!-- <P> -->
<!-- <DL> -->
<!-- <DT><U>Parameter:</U> <code>canvas-name</code> -->
<!-- <DD> -->
<!-- Defines a system-dependent name for a file. -->
<!-- </DL> -->

<DL>
<DT><U>Procedure:</U> <code>(canvas-reset)</code>
<DD>
Creates a new blank canvas on which subsequent calls to drawing procedures shall
draw.

<DT><U>Procedure:</U> <code>(canvas-refresh)</code>
<DD>
Returns a system-dependent identifier (not to be confused with Scheme
identifiers) of the canvas on which the procedures from
this package may draw.
The canvas may not exist unless it has been drawn on.

<DT><U>Procedure:</U> <code>(canvas-cleanup)</code>
<DD>
Deletes the current canvas and cleans the space it occupies.

<DT><U>Procedure:</U> <code>(draw-line start end)</code>
<DD>
Draws a line on the canvas starting at <code>(car start)</code> , <code> (car
(cdr start))</code> and ending at <code>(car end)</code> , <code> (car
(cdr end))</code>.

It is an error if <code>start</code> is not a list of at least two numbers.
It is an error if <code>end</code> is not a list of at least two numbers.

<DT><U>Procedure:</U> <code>(rogers v-list)</code>
<DD>
<p>Draws an image of MIT's founder, William Barton Rogers, as shown in
Figure 2.11 of SICP, on the canvas so that it fits the frame defined
by the vectors <code>(car v-list)</code>, <code>(cadr v-list)</code> and
<code>(caddr v-list)</code> in a natural linear algebraic way.</p>

<p>
It is an error if <code>v-list</code> is not a list of at least three elements,
each of which is a list of at least two numbers.</p>

<p>
<code>v-list</code> may be one of the possible implementations of a frame,
in the SICP terminology. However, in order to avoid nudging the potential
users of the library into a particular implementation of frames, we
opted to specify one of the possible underlying data structures directly.
Converting between this representation, as well as any other representation,
should be a relatively simple exercise.</p>

</DL>

<h3>Additional procedures</h3>

<p>These procedures, although they are not strictly needed for SICP, may make
programming with the picture language less mundane.</p>

<DL>
<DT><U>Procedure:</U> <code>(draw-bezier . v-list)</code>
<DD>

<p>Draws a cubic Bezier curve between the first and the last points in the
<code>v-list</code>. If the list has four elements, the middle two are
used as knots. If the list has three elements, the curve is a quadric curve.
Otherwise the result is unspecified.</p>

<p>
It is an error if <code>v-list</code> is not a list of at least three elements,
each of which is a list of at least two numbers.</p>

<DT><U>Procedure:</U> <code>(jpeg-file->painter file-name)</code>
<DD>

<p>If <code>file-name</code> exists and is a JPEG file,
<code>jpeg-file->painter</code> returns
a painter similar to <code>rogers</code>, that is a procedure that
accepts a frame and draws the image located at <code>file-name</code>
shifted, rotated, and skewed to fit into the frame.
Otherwise, the result is unspecified.</p>
</DL>


<h2>Implementation</h2>

<p>The <code>203.sld</code> and <code>203.scm</code> files constitute
a simple file-based implementation, in which the "system-dependent
identifier" corresponds to a file name.</p>
